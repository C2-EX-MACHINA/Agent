# POC

Start the server first:

```bash
python3 server_POC.py
```

Start agent when server is listening:

```bash
./C2_EX_MACHINA_Linux
```

Some commands are not  working on my Windows system (`netstat` and `tasklist`), i tried `calc` and `systeminfo` it's working good. I have no explanation for now.
